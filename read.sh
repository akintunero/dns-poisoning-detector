## Extending the Tool

The modular structure allows for easy extensions:

- `detector.py`: Implement new detection algorithms or enhance existing ones.
- `report_generator.py`: Customize report formats or add new visualization types.
- `utils.py`: Add utility functions for data processing or analysis.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Permission Denied**: Ensure the script is run with sudo privileges.
2. **No Packets Captured**: Verify network interface settings and firewall rules.
3. **ImportError**: Confirm all dependencies are correctly installed.
4. **Configuration Errors**: Check `config.yaml` for syntax errors or invalid values.

For detailed error information, refer to the log file specified in the configuration.
